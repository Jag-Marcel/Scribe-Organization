### Organization files and discussion

Scribe provides language keyboards that empower language learners to communicate with confidence and ease. This repository contains all the Scribe branding files and serves as a place for discussions relating to the Scribe organization itself.

Work that is in progress or could be implemented is tracked in the [Issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/issues) and [Projects](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/projects). Please see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing. Also note the use of the `--priority--` label that indicates which issues are most important.
